    Ninth Doctor:
    <br>
    The Ninth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's revival in 2005. Within the programme's narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.

    The production team's approach to the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, who was designed to be as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell, a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.

    In 2006, readers of Doctor Who Magazine voted Eccleston's Doctor the third most popular Doctor. Both mainstream press and science fiction reviewers generally credit Eccleston and his incarnation of the character as helping to re-establish the show following its hiatus between 1996 and 2005. The character's interactions with his archenemies, the Daleks, were particularly praised. Eccleston won several awards for his single series including the 2005 National Television Award for best actor.

    Character biography:
    <br>
    The Ninth Doctor first appears in the episode "Rose" where he rescues 19-year-old shopgirl Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) from an Auton attack in the department store where she works. After Rose helps the Doctor defeat the Nestene Consciousness (living plastic), he invites her to travel with him in the TARDIS.[1] On their first trip he takes her to witness the destruction of planet Earth in the year five billion. It is revealed that the Doctor's own species, the Time Lords, have been destroyed and the Doctor is the last of his kind.[2] Following from this they visit Cardiff in 1869 where they encounter author Charles Dickens, of whom the Doctor claims to be a big fan. When faced with a near death situation, the Doctor tells Rose that he was glad to have met her.[3] In taking Rose home the Doctor accidentally returns to earth 12 months after they left. Because of his actions he is treated like an Internet predator by Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri) and Rose's boyfriend Mickey (Noel Clarke) has become Rose's murder suspect.[4] After Mickey helps the Doctor and Rose defeat the Slitheen by firing a missile at their base at 10 Downing Street, the Doctor offers Mickey a place in the TARDIS with them but he refuses.[5] In the episode "Dalek" the Doctor encounters a Dalek, though he had believed the race to be extinct as the "Time War" between the Time Lords and Daleks concluded with the mutual annihilation of both races—an event for which the Doctor himself was responsible. The Doctor tortures the surviving Dalek and at the end of the episode attempts to kill it in cold blood. He refrains once Rose calls him out on this.[6]

    Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley) joins the Doctor and Rose as companion at the end of "Dalek".[6] However, when he tries to smuggle future knowledge from Satellite Five in the year 200,000 back to his own time in "The Long Game" the Doctor expels him from the TARDIS.[7] The Doctor is angry at Rose after he takes her to the event of father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall)'s death and she saves his life, causing a paradox. However, when Pete dies to restore the timeline he shows compassion and encourages her to sit by his side as he passes away.[8] After encountering Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) (a con artist and former Time Agent from the 51st century) in 1941, the Doctor realises Harkness had caused a deadly nanotechnological plague to sweep through the human race, turning humans into gas-mask zombies. Following the resolution of the situation, Jack prepares to sacrifice himself, but the Doctor saves him and invites him on board the TARDIS.[9] When the Doctor encounters Blon (Annette Badland), the only Slitheen to survive the Downing Street explosion in present-day Cardiff he has doubts over whether or not to send her home to be executed. During this episode the Doctor first notices that he and Rose had kept coming across the words "Bad Wolf".[10] In the episode "Bad Wolf" the Doctor, Rose and Jack find themselves at the mercy of the Bad Wolf Corporation based on Satellite Five. However, the true enemy is revealed to be the Daleks, the Dalek Emperor having also survived the Time War and had rebuilt the Dalek race.[11] The Doctor sends Rose back to the 21st century to protect her before attempting to destroy the Dalek army. When he realises that doing this would destroy most of planet Earth he is unable to do so, proclaiming he would rather be a coward than a killer. Having absorbed the energies of the time vortex, Rose is able to return to the Doctor and destroy the Daleks. To save Rose from being killed by harbouring the time vortex, the Doctor removes the harmful effects by kissing her. However, the damage to his cells causes him to regenerate and the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) takes his place.[12]

    The Ninth Doctor's origins were originally not explored in 2005, but were given in the show's fiftieth anniversary special, "The Day of the Doctor", in 2013. In the aftermath of the Time War, the War Doctor (John Hurt) succumbs to old age. The regeneration scene is cut short before Eccleston's likeness can be fully seen, as the actor declined to return for the episode and showrunner Steven Moffat wished to honour Eccleston's decision. Eccleston does, however, appear in stock footage and stills alongside the first eight Doctors.[13]

    Personality:
    <br>
    Eccleston stated in April 2004 that he did not believe his Doctor would be "as eccentric and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations".[29] Russell T Davies characterised the character as a "stripped down" version of previous Doctors.[39] Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord — that's eccentric enough to be getting on with".[40] In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character "is a scientist and an intellectual, and a lot of people seem to think you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of a black leather jacket and jeans, the actor states, "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" and that "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting."[30] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a "slight dark side" but also bring out a lighter side.[29] Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be "very intense but also frivolous as well."[39]
    <br>
    Eccleston felt that as a character his Doctor lives solely for the present. He avoids thinking about his past because "there's some pain there" – and his only concern regarding the future is that "it's there".[30] Eccleston felt that the character ultimately provides a life-affirming message stating that "In everything the Doctor does, he is saying 'it's great to be alive'."[30] In an interview with Newsround he stated that the Doctor accepts individuals regardless of colour and creed and expressed hope that the Doctor would encourage young children to appreciate life.[41] However, he also drew out differences between the Doctor and traditional children's heroes. The actor described the character as "brutal at times" and "confrontational" and "inflexible" stating that he "sometimes creates carnage" and that "there's nobody like him in Disney". Matthew Sweet of The Evening Standard highlighted the dichotomy of the character being "brave and wise and brilliant" but also "rough and ready" and "down-to-earth".[42]
    <br>
    A loose story arc that informed the Doctor's characterisation during the 2005 series is his feelings regarding the destruction of his own race, the Time Lords, which occurred offscreen before episode one. Eccleston felt that the episode "Dalek" showed the audience why his Doctor is the way he is and "how he feels about his past".[43] Russell T Davies remarked that the Ninth Doctor carries a lot of survival guilt; this is why he "strides through the universe wearing a dark leather jacket saying "Don't touch me"".[43] Davies felt that "Dalek" provided a "bit of therapy" and after this he "starts to rebuild himself". In the episode "The Parting of the Ways" the Doctor sacrifices his ninth life to save Rose. Davies felt it was important to take the Doctor away from mythological off stage concepts such as the Time War and provide a conclusion that focused on the relationship between the character and Rose.[43] John Barrowman, who played Captain Jack, felt that the Doctor's decision to save Rose enabled a catharsis; as he sacrifices himself to save her he is "letting go of the burden of the Time Lords being destroyed".[43]

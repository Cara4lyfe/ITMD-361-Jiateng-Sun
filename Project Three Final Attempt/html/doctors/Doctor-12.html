    Twelfth Doctor:
    <br>
    The Twelfth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi.[1] Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body, and in doing so gain a new physical appearance, and with it a distinct new personality; this plot mechanism has allowed the Doctor to be portrayed by a series of actors over the decades since the programme's inception in 1963. Capaldi's portrayal of the Doctor is a spiky, brusque, contemplative, and pragmatic character who conceals his emotions in the course of making tough and sometimes ruthless decisions.
    <br>
    Capaldi made his first, very brief appearance as the Doctor in the show's fiftieth anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor" (2013), as one of the thirteen incarnations of the Doctor who are summoned to save Gallifrey from destruction. Capaldi's first full appearance as the Doctor was at the end of the 2013 Christmas special "The Time of the Doctor".[2][3] He is accompanied in the eighth and ninth series by companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman).[4] In the tenth series, he will be accompanied by two new companions: Nardole (Matt Lucas)[5] and Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie).[6] On 30 January 2017, Capaldi announced he would be leaving the programme, with the 2017 Christmas episode being his last.[7] He also appeared in an episode of Class, marking the third time the Doctor appeared in a spin-off.

    Matt Smith, who played the Eleventh Doctor, publicly announced his departure from Doctor Who on 1 June 2013,[8] triggering extensive media speculation on the subject.[9] On 3 August 2013, bookmakers William Hill suspended betting when Capaldi became the five to six favourite to be cast.[10] Capaldi's casting was revealed on 4 August during a live broadcast on BBC One, titled Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor.[11] The live show was watched by an average of 6.27 million in the UK, and was also simulcast in the United States, Canada and Australia.[12]

    While Capaldi was the first choice for the role, other actors were also approached in case Capaldi should turn the offer down. Ben Daniels, who was an early favourite following the announcement of Matt Smith's departure,[9] said that he had been approached with a view to assessing whether he would be interested in playing the Doctor, with his name remaining as a potential contender until just before the live BBC broadcast.[13]

    Doctor Who head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat said that Capaldi "briefly flicked through [his] mind" while casting the Eleventh Doctor, but that he dismissed the idea, thinking he was not right for the part at the time.[3] Ben Stephenson, the BBC's drama commissioner, said that Capaldi was suggested months before the August revelation and that a secret audition was held at Moffat's home.[2] Capaldi prepared for the audition by downloading old Doctor Who scripts from the Internet and practising in front of a mirror. He discovered he had been given the part during filming for Adrian Hodges' The Musketeers in Prague; after missing a call from his agent, Capaldi rang back to be greeted with "Hello, Doctor!"[3] At 55 years old when originally cast, Capaldi was only a few months younger than William Hartnell (the First Doctor) was, when he was cast in the role,[3] and is the oldest actor since Hartnell to star as The Doctor[14] and the third oldest to portray the character.[15] Moffat felt that an older actor would work best following the youngest actor, as it would both provide a change and lessen comparisons. He commented, "I can absolutely believe that the strange old-young Matt Smith will turn into the strange young-old Peter Capaldi."[16]

    Capaldi has previously appeared playing other roles in the Doctor Who franchise. He portrayed Lobus Caecilius in the 2008 episode "The Fires of Pompeii" and John Frobisher in Children of Earth, the 2009 serial of the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood.[3][17] Moffat has stated that he plans on explaining over time why there are three characters in the Doctor Who universe with the same appearance; his predecessor Russell T Davies had once explained to him a theory for the first two, and upon Capaldi's casting assured Moffat that the explanation would still work.[18] This situation was alluded to in "Deep Breath", when a confused Doctor is reminded of Caecilius when he examines his face in a mirror.[19] In "The Girl Who Died", it is explained that the Doctor chose Caecilius' face to remind himself that he is the Doctor, and that he can always save people.[20] While not explained in the episode, Moffat later said that he also shares a face with John Frobisher as Frobisher is Caecilius's descendant, and represents the end of Caecilius's bloodline, referencing the Doctor's "eternal battle with doom and destiny."[21] Capaldi's casting marks the second time an actor has previously appeared in the series and then been cast as an incarnation of the Doctor, the first being Colin Baker.[22]

    Capaldi briefly appears in the 50th anniversary special. Moffat stated that it was his "plan from the start" that all the Doctors would fly in to save Gallifrey, and he knew there would be a new one at that time. He wrote it before knowing who would be cast.[23] Capaldi filmed his appearance on 3 October 2013, long after principal photography for the special had ended, and the same day he filmed his debut scene for "The Time of the Doctor".[24]

    Capaldi kept his native Scottish accent for the role.[25][26][27][28] Speaking on his decision, he said he did it so he could feel closer to the character.[29] A handful of tweets were reported in September 2014 in which it was claimed that some viewers struggled to understand Capaldi. A speech coach and linguistics expert both suggested that any problems with understanding Capaldi had more to do with delivery than accent.[30]

    On 30 January 2017, Capaldi confirmed that the tenth series would be his last.[7] Regarding his decision to leave, Capaldi stated that despite his tremendous love for the show, he was unsure if he would be able to deliever at his best performance if he remained in the role for too long.[31] Following his announcment, several media reports and bookmakers have speculated as to who will replace Capaldi as the Thirteenth Doctor, with Ben Whishaw, Olivia Colman, Richard Madden, Maxine Peake, Kris Marshall, and Tilda Swinton among the most popular predictions

    Personality:
    <br>
    The Twelfth Doctor is, according to Capaldi, "more alien than he's been in a while."[44] Whilst still defining himself as someone who "saves people,"[45] the Twelfth Doctor cares little about being seen as a hero or even being liked by the people who he is trying to save.[46] Unlike his previous two incarnations who cared about humans and tried to understand them, Capaldi has confirmed that, this incarnation "doesn't quite understand human beings or really care very much about their approval." Clara is put on the back-foot by him post-regeneration[47] initially not seeing through his 'Tough Exterior'.[48] Playing Clara, Jenna Coleman says of this Doctor, "He's more removed, you can't quite access him in the same way", in comparison to his more friendly and accessible predecessor.[49] Initially it was reported that Capaldi specifically requested that the Doctor will not flirt with his companion the way his previous incarnation did,[40] but the actor stated that he said no such thing and that it was inflated by the media.[50] Steven Moffat has teased that Capaldi's Doctor may perhaps be more in love with Clara than he'd like to believe.[51] He has also been described as a "total adrenaline junkie" and, according to Moffat, "much fiercer, madder [and] less reliable".[52] "He's not as immediately approachable and he's not necessarily looking for your approval, when he says 'Wait here, I'll be back', you're not absolutely convinced... what he's not doing is reassuring you very much."[53]
    <br>
    Mark Gatiss said that Capaldi's Doctor was "sort of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and even Christopher Eccleston style...it's someone who's not immediately going to be your best friend and can be quite abrupt and rude."[54] Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, "He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour and a lot of it is around the fact that sometimes he is terribly rude. I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] You might want to cuddle him but he really will resist."[55] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share "a certain acid wit" of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous".[56][57][58] Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal[59] and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison.[57] He has been described as an "older, fiercer, trickier Doctor".[60] In spite of his darker personality, Capaldi has said that the Doctor is still, "funny, joyful, passionate, emphatic, and fearless." While Jenna Coleman added that this time, the Doctor is more "enigmatic, mysterious, complex, worn, and unmannered" when compared to his immediate two predecessors. Steven Moffat has joked that he's "more Scottish than last time."[61]
    <br>
    In Series 9, Capaldi described his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises that he is 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'.[62] According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously she was trying to keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.”[63] Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.[64]

    For Series 10, Capaldi described his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' than the previous season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following this Doctor, you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi expressed in terms of his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker. So I think that makes for a very interesting character.'[65]
